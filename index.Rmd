## What is word stress?

The **stressed syllable** within a word is the most prominent syllable  . This prominence can be expressed via:

* Loudness
* Length
* Pitch

For example, in English '<span class="example"><span class="stress">Ba</span>by</span>', the syllable <span class="example">-ba</span> is the most prominent syllable.

## German word stress

In German (and English), stress position varies between words. Examples: <div class="example"><span class="stress">Bei</span>spiel ('example'), Zer<span class ="stress">brech</span>lichkeit ('frailty'), unter<span class ="stress">hal</span>ten ('to converse'), kontrol<span class="stress">lie</span>ren ('to control')</div>

<br>There are **regularities**, e.g., most (all?) unprefixed words that are not loan words are stressed on the first syllable.

<br>However, the distribution of German word stress is not clear. For example, how often does stress occur on the second syllable of a word?
